### Task solving steps:

• I researched about both API’s (binance and crypto), and test their endpoints.
• The binance.com API was working fine, i.e providing the required data.
• But the crypto.com API requires cell phone verification and there was no verification method provided for pakistani +92 code.
• Then i created a user interface in react.js which displays data from binance.com API.
• After that i did more research about crypto.com API but noting work’s.
• Then finally i visits crypto.com and get their symbols price and store in a javascript file.
• Then displays the differnce between both datasets.
• Finally stores the data in the firebase.
